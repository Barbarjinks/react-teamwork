# React Teamwork

Fetch external data to power React components, practice props and state, while all the while working as a team ðŸ’ª

## Getting Started

### Clone down this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/react-teamwork.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Checkout to your feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b descriptive-feature-branch-name-here
```

### Start up the application and visit both routes available:

```bash
npm start
```

## Be curious

### Visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

You should see a **HOME** message

### Visit `localhost:8080/:username` in your browser.

With `username` being any string you wish to use as username, you should see a skeleton user profile.  

## Challenge

### Three teams will work on three different features
